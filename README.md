# AngularJS101

A `generator-aspnet` rewrite of the [ASP.Net 5: Jump Start to AngularJS With MVC 6 Web API' article](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/8c19e8/Asp-Net-5-jump-start-to-angularjs-with-mvc-6-web-api/)

## Prerequisitues

* No `Visual Studio 2015` the original article is using. You can use `Visual Studio Code` or any other editor of your choice

* the `Node`, `Yeoman` and `generator-aspnet` tools installed on your machine. See introductory article: [Building Projects with Yeoman](http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/client-side/yeoman.html)

* you are somehow comfortable with command-line tools
